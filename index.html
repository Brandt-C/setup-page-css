            <h1>What am I doing here?</h1>
            <p> Having been through a multitude of different
                careers, locations, and lifestyles it seems like this is a path worth 
                pursuing.  I'll spare the entire backstory but to make a long story short:
                <em>I like working with both my hands and my head.  It's time to bring both
                    aspects together.
                </em>
            </p>

            <h2>Where's here?</h2>
            <p>The venture begins with <strong>Coding Temple.</strong>Having started working
                 with <em>Python</em>, and <em>HTML/CSS</em> it's time to really start cramming 
                some more knowledge/skills in.</p>

            <h2>The Backstory you were threatened with before-</h2>
            <p>As a really old dude, like <em><b>mid-thirties </b></em>old, I'm learning about that big
            spider web that's run by really expensive calculators!  But really. . . I'm a family
            guy that hasn't quite grown to <i>Peter Griffin</i> proportions just yet.  A wife and two young 
            kids are my life while things are learned about computers on the side.  I've spent a ton of time 
            in the restaurant/hospitality industry and, most recently, as a Mortgage Loan Officer.  There was 
            also a period of time that I owned my own business.  Maybe it's time to just settle down into that 
            "regular" job I've heard about working 40 hours/wk and getting paid ridiculous sums of money.  If  
            that sounds like something you offer <i>please </i><strong> see 'Contact' to help me make that a 
            reality! </strong></p>
